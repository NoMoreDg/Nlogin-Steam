# Nlogin-Steam By NoMoreDoge on DISCORD
Nlogin Steam is a batch script that will help you change your steam account fast.
(As a alternative for the integrated steam menu to switch accounts)

# Changelog
Added the English Language for SlimVersion of Nlogin-Steam as its the most
stable version and mostly bug free. (This script works on almost all windows versions)

Changed logo from a cannabis leaf (The leaf was requested by a user to be included inside
the script as a default feature, also you can only customize the ASCII on 
the old X2V2 version) to " NLOGIN " 3D Dynamic ASCII ART (Dynamic meaning it changes colors
based on colors from 1 to 6).

# Languages
1. Romanian (Old ver X2V2)
2. English (New ver X2V3)

# How to use
1. Create a folder inside a drive (Ex. C:\)
2. Drag and drop the .bat script
3. Right click and "send to desktop" (You can also set a custom name by renaming
 and icon by going to properties)
4. Open it up and do the basic setup
5. When using the menu to login just execute (Hitting E on the correct username)
6. When seeing the login prompt of Steam just login normally with
   !" REMEMBER PASSWORD "! enabled
   (The script does not log any login information, it works based on a
   remember password feature inside steam to keep multiple tokens active)
7. Done. After that the only workaround to be able to login inside an account
   only one time it would be to Hit B inside the console to logout (wont keep
   any tokens inside the computer for that specific account even if you do
   enable remember password inside the steam login menu)

# How to add or remove accounts?
Open "User.cc" with any text editor (including notepad) and change the first number
Ex. from 4 to 5
Then replace the Empty space under the last username with new username and at the bottom
put the alias for that username

# How to change username aliases?
Open "User.cc" and after the "VVV" mark/line change the names with whatever you want
(Ignore the language if you are using English version, i was too lazy to do a change)

# How to update?
Simply drag and drop the new version, I will include in every version the support for
old files or bonus scripts to convert/update to the new version

# Goals? (since i've started the project)
‚úÖ 3 Active usernames
‚úÖ 6 Active usernames
‚úÖ 9 Active usernames
‚úÖ 12 Active usernames
‚úÖ 6 per user colors
‚ùå 12 per user colors - (Removed in newer version because it was causing
  my lazy ass a lot of confusion when updating the script because i was unable to
‚úÖ understand my own work but i will include it later üòÇ)
‚úÖ Customizable colors
‚úÖ Username aliases
‚úÖ WASD controls
‚úÖ Disco mode (older version)
‚ùå Customizable ASCII ART? (Removed recently for some testing and forgot to
  put it back, i will do a workaround that will still update the ig.txt file
  and at the same time if you have customig.txt to use that instead of ig.txt)
‚ùå Installer with .ps1  - (i will work on a simple install script with powershell
  to just open the console and execute the command that will do simple basic work 
  for lazy people)
‚ùå Conversion to .ps1   - (maybe i will do a simple command to execute from github
  with windows powershell, why? smaller file size but will be limited just for
  On-Line/access to internet only, also pretty useless in that case)
‚ùå External advanced color changer (maybe i will)
‚ùå External language files
‚ùå Read and convert both Romanian and English CC.cc/ENCC.cc to a single file in case
  someone wants a newer version untill updating script to newer version (unless
  i update to file based language and no needing for this script anymore)

# Any ideeas you guys have?
‚ùìSend me requests (messages) over on discord and maybe i will include
  them in my goals list (i will make a special server with ticketing system for that)

  (And please dont spam or self advertise, i will block and/or report you!)
