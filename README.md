# Nlogin-Steam By NoMoreDoge on DISCORD
Nlogin Steam is a batch script that will help you change your steam account fast.

(As a alternative for the integrated steam menu to switch accounts)

# Changelog
Added the English Language for SlimVersion of Nlogin-Steam as its the most
stable version and mostly bug free. (This script works on almost all windows versions)

Changed logo from a cannabis leaf (The leaf was requested by a user to be included inside
the script as a default feature, also you can only customize the ASCII on 
the old X2V2 version) to " NLOGIN " 3D Dynamic ASCII ART (Dynamic meaning it changes colors
based on colors from 1 to 6).

# Languages
1. Romanian (New ver X2V6)
2. English (Language.bat addon+lgctrl.txt file needed)

(language files does not affect ENCC.cc for future reasons.. more addons)

# How to use
1. Create a folder inside a drive (Ex. C:\)
   
2. Drag and drop the .bat script

3. Open it up and do the basic setup

4. When using the menu to login just execute (Hitting E on the correct username)

5. When seeing the login prompt of Steam just login normally with
   !" REMEMBER PASSWORD "! enabled
   (The script does not log any login information, it works based on a
   remember password feature inside steam to keep multiple tokens active)

6. Done. After that the only workaround to be able to login inside an account
   only one time it would be to Hit B inside the console to logout (wont keep
   any tokens inside the computer for that specific account even if you do
   enable remember password inside the steam login menu)

7. To create a shortcut right-click StartNLogin.bat, select send-to, desktop
   (win 11 users: ight-click StartNLogin.bat, show-more-options, select send-to, desktop)

# How to add or remove accounts?
Open "User.cc" with any text editor (including notepad) and change the first number
Ex. from 4 to 5

Then replace the Empty space under the last username with new username and at the bottom
put the alias for that username

# How to change username aliases?
Open "User.cc" and after the "VVV" mark/line change the names with whatever you want
(Ignore the language if you are using English version, i was too lazy to do a change)

# How to update?
No need.. since X2V6 the script has an autoupdater
(if it doesnt work just remove the old file and place the new one inside the folder 
then open it and it should generate a new version.txt for StartNLogin.bat to use)

# How to use/install addons?
Simply drag and drop them inside the same file with the NLogin Script
(for language files just drag the lgctrl.txt file inside the folder aswell)

# Getting Error from new X2V4 Update while using language addon?
Just put a language file found inside either RAR file in the releases page
Either on main page all the way to the top inside languages folder and download
specific language file.

# Not working?
Make sure you are using windows 10 or above as the older ones were not tested.

# Goals? (since i've started the project)
✅ 3 Active usernames

✅ 6 Active usernames

✅ 9 Active usernames

✅ 12 Active usernames

✅ 6 per user colors

❌ 12 per user colors - (maybe next update)

✅ Customizable colors

✅ Username aliases

✅ WASD controls

✅ Disco mode (older version)

❌ (REQUESTED) DISCO MODE for igcustom.txt or internal ig.txt (DISCO MODE COMING
   BACK WITH A NEW ALTERNATIVE FOR INTEGRATED IG AND CUSTOM IG/ASCII ART
   IT WILL BE DISPLAYED ONLY AS A SECRET EASTEREGG)

✅ (REQUESTED) Customizable ASCII ART? (place ASCIIUI.bat inside the folder with the launcher and the main script)

✅ AUTOUPDATER using CURL.

❌ No need for a external color changer for now (only to make it as a optional addon)
   for now is integrated and changed since X2V6 to be more modular (to be able to add more customizations)

✅ Smaller script for color variables (does some console fixes)

✅ Mode CON for OS based console (no effect on windows 11 but it will take
   effect between windows 7 and 10)

✅ (REQUESTED) External language files

# Thinking this script is useless?
- Well... this app strated developing way before steam ever had a change account
  option.
- Steam will always require you to enter your steam guard every time you change
  the account to existing one.
  (This script will allow steam to store multiple tokens inside windows so you
  wont need steam guard codes ever again with a faster account switcher)
- One time login, dont worry about steam not working/offline servers.
  (It means you can launch multiple accounts without steam verifying your
  session , please dont use this script to/try to violate steam TOS)
- Some of the features are useless, but you know what makes a better experience?
  USELESS FEATURES FOR NO REASON.

# Any ideeas you guys have?
❓Send me requests (messages) over on discord and maybe i will include
  them in my goals list (i will make a special server with ticketing system for that)

  (And please dont spam or self advertise, i will block and/or report you!)
